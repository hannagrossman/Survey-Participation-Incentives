# Survey-Participation-Incentives
Project to test the hypothesis that financial and social good incentives have a positive treatment effect on the amount of time taken and number of questions answered by people responding to surveys

I completed this project with a team as a part of an Experiments and Causal Inference course (W241) in UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science Program.
